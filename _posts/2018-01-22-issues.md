You can report any bug you find in PF4J framework in our [github](https://github.com/decebals/pf4j/issues) issues list. We will happily discuss it there.  
It's recomanded to create a quickstart to accompany a bug report. If you report a bug (in Github or on the mailing list) the core developers may not be able to recreate it easily.
